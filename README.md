# lenfind
Command line utility to get the length of a YouTube playlist

### To install:

1. Git clone this repository/download it as a folder
2. Move the lenfind.py file into usr/local/bin (or create a symlink)
3. Remove the .py extension, chmod +x it so that it becomes an executable

### To use:

1. Once the program has been added to usr/local/bin, or added to PATH in some other way, it can be used. In your terminal, type lenfind "" (the quotation marks may or may not be needed depdending on whether your shell treats '?' as a globbing wildcard character. zsh does this, I don't think bash does but I may be wrong)
